# 🎮 Chumma Oru Rasam 🎉  
*"Because normal websites are boring"*  

Welcome to **Chumma Oru Rasam** – a completely unnecessary, totally over-the-top fun hub where logic takes a vacation and chaos runs the show.  
It’s a place where clicking random buttons can change your life… or just play a cat meowing in your face.  



## 🚀 Features  

🧩 **Puzzle of the Day** – Riddles that make you feel smart… or confused.  
📜 **Daily Quote** – Inspiring words to motivate you (or confuse you more).  
✊ **Rock Paper Scissors** – With an actually thinking(?) computer.  
🧠 **Memory Game** – Train your brain before you forget why you came here.  
⭕ **Tic Tac Toe** – Beat your friend or an AI that just might troll you.  
🎆 **Fireworks Mode** – Explosions of pixels, because why not?  
🐾 **Animal Sounds** – Deer, dogs, birds, and cats just for fun.    
🥱 **Useless Button** – It does something… sometimes.  
🥔 **Potato Mode** – Turns the site into a potato wonderland.  
🐱 **Cat Takeover** – Cats will walk across your screen. Yes, really.  
⚡ **Rapid Tap Challenge** – How fast can you click before your fingers fall off?
