Project Description
Chumma Oru Rasam is a whimsical web app offering a collection of fun, quirky mini-games and activities like Rapid Tap Challenge, Firework Show, and Cat Takeover, designed to entertain users with absurdly delightful experiences.

The Problem 
In a world of boring productivity apps, people suffer from a severe lack of pointless, giggle-inducing distractions to waste their time creatively.

The Solution 
We’ve crafted a chaotic playground of mini-games and activities—think tapping furiously for no reason, triggering virtual fireworks, or listening to animal sounds—because who needs purpose when you have rasam (spice) in life?
